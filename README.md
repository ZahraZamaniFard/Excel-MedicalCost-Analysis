# Excel-MedicalCost-AnalysisThis
This is my first Excel project from a Data Analytics course.

I analyzed the Medical Cost dataset by:
- Grouping individuals by North/South and East/West
- Calculating total cost, count, and average BMI for each group
- Categorizing individuals by BMI (<20, 20-30, >30)
- Calculating average cost for non-smokers
- Calculating average cost for smokers with BMI over 30

Tools used: Microsoft Excel.
