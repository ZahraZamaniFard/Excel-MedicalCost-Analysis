# Excel Medical Cost Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a Medical Cost dataset in Excel.
The goal was to practice data grouping, aggregation, and conditional calculations using Excel formulas.

##  Tasks and Methods

 Sheet 1: Divided individuals into North and South groups.
Calculated: total members, total costs, average BMI
 Used formulas: IF, COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS

Sheet 2: Divided individuals into East and West groups.
Calculated: total members, total costs, average BMI
Used formulas: COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS

Sheet 3: Categorized individuals into three BMI ranges (<20, 20â€“30, >30).
Calculated: total members, average medical costs
Used formulas: IFS, COUNTIFS, AVERAGEIFS
Sheet 4: Calculated the average medical costs for non-smokers.
Used formula: AVERAGEIFS

Sheet 5: Calculated the average medical costs for smokers with BMI > 30.
Used formula: AVERAGEIFS

## Key Learnings:

Through this project, I practiced:

-Conditional formulas (IF, IFS)
-Aggregation functions (COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS)
-Applying Excel formulas to real-world healthcare cost data
